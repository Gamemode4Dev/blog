## Branding Refresh & Blog

### Blog

This blog is now a thing! Some older posts from other community projects will make an appearance here, so that they can be preserved. 

The type of content you can expect here will be:
- Update posts (just like this)
- Longer features on parts of the project
- Changelogs, usually tied to a Minecraft Update

### Tag Lines
Since the founding of Gamemode 4, we have been using the tagline:
> No Mods, Just Modules

Since the move *away* from command blocks ,in 1.13, towards datapacks, it did not make much sense. We are now moving to use:
> Creating *magic* using Datapacks

If you spot anywhere that still seems to use the old tagline, give us a ping on [our discord!](https://gm4.co/discord)

### A new thumbnail style

A lot of our thumbnails do not show you what the video is about. Thanks to fantastic work by @Dennis-0 and @ToffeeMax, we are now working towards creating a new style. Below is an example for our module, [Sweethearts](https://gm4.co/modules/sweethearts)

### Wiki Changes
The front page of the [wiki](https://wiki.gm4.co) has had a update. Hopefully this is more enticing compared to the previous layout.

As always, we are looking for contributors to help keep things up to date. Ask in `#wiki-chat` on Discord for more info.

## GitHub

### This Blog & LinkTree

This [blog](https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/blog) and our [LinkTree](https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/LinkTree) can be viewed on GitHub.

We'd happily accept contributions/fixes. Even better if it is one of the issues for features we have created!
