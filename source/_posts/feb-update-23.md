Welcome
-------

Hello: Welcome to this VERY late post. It is covering changes from December to Mid-Feb (16th February)!

There may be some items missed, so do not take this update post as the true gospel; use it as a headline update about the amazing health of the Gamemode 4 project!

GitHub

Here is a run down of changes to the datapacks/GitHub side of the project.

YouTube
-------

We've released two horizontal videos since November and a plethora of livestreams and shorts.

### Livestreams

Gamemode 4 has a series called "Gamemode 4 Toolbox"; these are designed to either showcase new features upcoming in GM4, livestreaming development, or developing concepts.

These are currently infrequent, and are usually announced via our [Discord](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gm4.co/discord&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1681061831194888&usg=AOvVaw3AO4Iv9XcShEcabahgOuLS) by adding the ` @stream notifications`role in #bot. 

#### Beet Development Livestream

This expands on the new Beet 2 development pipeline that Gamemode 4 is now using [(#828)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/GM4_Datapacks/commits/master&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1681061831196082&usg=AOvVaw0EX1Ur-O-Byvw8JzbFgGHk). 

#### Spawner Minecarts

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vdn0HqgSFsM?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Spawner Minecarts has not been revisited since the 1.13 update, with the original concept created by Eease for Hermitcraft Gamemode 4.

> "Be it a lack of will to innovate or an over-nerf, the state of Spawner Minecarts was dire, and it felt like a relic from another time; too complicated for what it's supposed to be." - Bloo

### Shorts

#### What is a Custom Crafter?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJrExFVXqxI?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The recipe of a custom crafter changed! This short aimed to show new players and old how the customer crafter recipe was modified during the machine blocks update.

### Horizontal Video

#### What is the Ramble?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZVaf--Xc4o?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Public Server 9 has (now completed) the Ramble! This video was made to explain the location of the Ramble, and how to access it. 
  
You can still explore the Ramble now and do the puzzles. It is best to take along a group of friends to complete it!

#### Supercut of the World Tour

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xVyrTyJX7I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The closing of Public Server 8 had some interesting moments. This is a supercut of the most suspect.
